/**
 * The gate now answers two questions, not one.
 *
 * It used to answer only "who is this", with a local `requireUser` whose
 * history is worth keeping: it called `auth.getClaims`, which did not exist in
 * the supabase-js version this function pinned, so every request died with a
 * TypeError *in the gate* — ahead of the request's try/catch. The isolate
 * answered 500 with no CORS headers, the browser was not allowed to read that,
 * and the chat showed "Failed to fetch".
 *
 * `gate` keeps both of those properties — it returns a verdict rather than
 * throwing, and every answer carries CORS headers, because a 401 the browser
 * cannot read is indistinguishable from the server being down — and adds the
 * second question: may this person spend the project's model budget right now.
 * Authentication was never an answer to that one.
