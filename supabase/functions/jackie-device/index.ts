/**
 * jackie-device — Jackie's system prompt for the engine that runs in the owner's browser.
 *
 * The on-device engine runs Bonsai 1.7B in the tab (src/lib/microai/bonsaiDevice.ts),
 * so no function ever sees its answer. It still has to answer as Jackie: an engine
 * without the persona answers as an anonymous assistant, and an engine without
 * the morals is the one the guard rail exists to catch (rule 6).
 *
 * The persona cannot simply ship to the browser — it is kept out of the bundle
 * so that anyone who loads the app cannot download it — so the device asks for
 * it here, once per message, and gets it built by the same guard every other
 * engine uses. That also leaves the same attestation behind, so the morals page
 * shows what the device ran next to what the other engines ran.
 *
 * Owner-only, like jacky-proxy and jackie-ollama: the device engine is the
 * owner's own hardware, and handing the persona to any signed-in account would
 * be publishing it. No quota: nothing here calls a model.
 *
 * The question itself is never sent. Only the memory context travels, and that
 * came from the owner's own database in the first place.
