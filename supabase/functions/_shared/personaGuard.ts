/**
 * The system prompt every engine sends, and a record of which one it was.
 *
 * Every persona-built prompt now carries the owner's morals, read here from
 * the database with the service role — never from the request, because a
 * caller who could send the morals could also leave them out. And every
 * request leaves an attestation behind: which persona and which morals this
 * engine actually ran, by fingerprint, or that a caller replaced the persona
 * with a system prompt of its own. The morals page compares those against what
 * the owner sealed, which is how a change nobody announced becomes visible.
 *
 * Call it only after the request has been admitted: it reads the database and
 * writes the attestation, and neither is for an anonymous caller to trigger.
 *
 * It never throws. If the morals cannot be loaded the answer still goes out on
 * the base persona — refusing would take the whole chat down until a migration
 * is pushed — but the attestation says "persona-without-morals" and why, so the
 * morals page shows it in red rather than letting it pass as normal (rule 8).
