/**
 * What the chat function accepts, and what it does with it.
 *
 * The gate that broke the chat was an auth crash (see `authGate.ts`), but it
 * hid a second class of failure that looks identical from the user's chair:
 * the request reaches the model gateway, the gateway refuses it, and the UI
 * shows an empty bubble or a generic "Something went wrong". The causes are
 * all the same shape — something in the request was not what the gateway
 * expected — and all of them are cheap to catch here, where the answer can say
 * which thing it was.
 *
 * So this module owns the request contract:
 *
 *   - the model list, which the browser and the function now read from the
 *     same place, so the picker cannot offer a model the function rejects;
 *   - message validation, so a malformed history is a 400 that names the
 *     problem rather than a 500 from somewhere downstream;
 *   - a bound on the injected context, because Jackie's memory, tasks and file
 *     summaries are all concatenated into the system prompt and grow without
 *     limit as the vault fills. Past the gateway's ceiling every request fails,
 *     and it fails for a reason nothing in the UI could explain.
 *
 * Pure functions, no Deno and no network, so `src/test/chat-request.test.ts`
 * imports this exact file — and so does the browser, through
 * `src/lib/jackie-stream.ts`.
