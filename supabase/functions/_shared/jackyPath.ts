/**
 * What the jacky proxy is allowed to reach.
 *
 * The proxy forwards to a host that is not on the internet — the owner's own
 * rig, holding GPU control, model management and a secrets file — and it
 * attaches the server's `JACKY_API_TOKEN` to whatever it sends. So the path is
 * the security boundary, and it was not being checked.
 *
 * The original stripped leading slashes and interpolated the rest:
 *
 *     fetch(`${base}/api/${rawPath}`)
 *
 * `..` survives that, and `new URL()` then collapses it, so any authenticated
 * caller could ask for `../../admin` and reach `${base}/admin` — off the `/api`
 * prefix entirely, carrying the server's credentials. Anything the rig serves
 * was reachable.
 *
 * The fix is an allowlist rather than a blocklist. The client contract is five
 * calls and they are all here; a blocklist of `..` would still leave the next
 * encoding trick to be discovered, while a shape that must match cannot be
 * talked into fetching something else.
