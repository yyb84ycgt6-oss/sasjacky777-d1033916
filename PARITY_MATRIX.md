# Parity Matrix

The living tracker `FLEET_PARITY_PLAN.md` §6 calls for. **Generated**, not hand-kept:
run `node scripts/gen-parity-matrix.mjs` to rebuild it from `src/lib/routeManifest.ts`
and `src/eru/routes.generated.ts`, so a renamed route changes this file in the same
commit instead of quietly making it wrong.

Last generated: 2026-09-12 · 45 native routes + 84 Eru modules.

## How to read the status column

| Status | Means |
|---|---|
| `native` | Built in this app, in TSX, on this app's own backend. |
| `via-embed` | Served by the embedded PC OS under `public/pc-os/`, framed by a route here. |
| `imported` | An Eru page ported into `src/eru/`, running on the shared shell. |
| `todo` | Named in the plan, not built here. |

Only Jackie's column is filled in: this repo can see its own routes and nothing else.
**Eru and PC columns need someone with those repos open** — that is the missing half of
this tracker, and pretending otherwise is what §6 was trying to avoid.

## Eru modules

84 pages are mounted under `/eru/*` from `src/eru/routes.generated.ts`,
all `imported`, all rendering (`npm run smoke`). They are listed there rather than
repeated here — that file is generated from Eru's own App.jsx and is the authority.

## What this tracker cannot tell you

- **Whether an imported page works against a real backend.** `npm run smoke` proves each
  renders; it does not prove Base44 or Supabase answers it.
- **Feature-level parity.** This is a route census. The per-app checklist §6 describes needs
  `FEATURE_AUDIT.md`, which is not in this repo.
