/**
 * This used to be `createLovableConfig()` from
 * `lovable-agent-playwright-config/config` — a package that is in neither
 * package.json nor the lockfile. In a clean checkout the config failed to
 * resolve, so `playwright test` could not start at all: not a failing suite, a
 * suite that never ran. `@playwright/test` itself was installed the whole time,
 * so the only thing missing was the wrapper.
 *
 * Plain defineConfig has no such dependency.
 *
 * `testDir` is deliberately outside `src/`, because vitest owns
 * `src/ **­/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}` and a Playwright spec picked up by vitest
 * fails in a way that reads like a broken test rather than a misrouted one.
