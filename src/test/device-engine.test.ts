/**
 * The `device` rung.
 *
 * `contextRouter.ts` promised an offline-first ladder — device, then LAN, then
 * network — and only the LAN rungs existed. The Keeper router, whose entire
 * contract is `ladder: ["device"]` because vault context must never leave the
 * machine, therefore had no engine at all and could not answer a single
 * question.
 *
 * These cover the rung itself: that it stays cheap until asked, that it refuses
 * honestly when it cannot run, and that it never claims to have answered when
 * it has not.
