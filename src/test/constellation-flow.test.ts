/**
 * The flow's whole job is to refuse to advance when a required station did not
 * answer. A test that only ever feeds it live stations proves nothing about
 * that — it exercises the one branch that was never in doubt.
 *
 * So each case here pins a specific verdict and asserts the consequence: which
 * stage is current, whether the walk is complete, and where the single next
 * action points. The stations are the real table, built over stub boundaries,
 * so a station that changes stage or loses its `required` flag shows up here.
