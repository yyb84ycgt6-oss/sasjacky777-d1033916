/**
 * third_party/ holds other people's projects, each copied whole and untouched by
 * scripts/vendor.sh at the commit third_party/UPSTREAM pins. Whether a copy
 * still matches upstream byte for byte needs the network, so `vendor.sh --check`
 * proves that; what can be checked offline is checked here, because each of
 * these has a way of going wrong without anybody noticing:
 *
 * - a folder nobody recorded is code with no provenance and no way to update it;
 * - a project shipped without its licence is one this repository may not hold;
 * - FilmCraft pins craft-libs in its Cargo.toml, and a vendored craft-libs at a
 *   different commit is a copy that silently is not the one FilmCraft builds.
