/**
 * Game modes: the ways to play a world, from the classics to the minigames

 * defence, parkour, TNT Run, UHC, speedruns, lucky blocks — and challenges
 * that bend a normal world (random drops, one heart).
 *
 * A mode is chosen when a world is created and kept in its meta: which map
 * pack it is built on (engine/maps.ts), the game mode and rules it starts
 * with, and what it has kept track of since (`ModeState.data`). What a mode
 * does while it runs lives in its runtime (modes/runtime.ts and the files
 * beside it); this file is only what it is, so the create screen, the tests
 * and a guest can read it without the game.
