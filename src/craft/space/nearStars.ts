/**
 * The stars and places of the real Milky Way the map shows by name: every
 * star system within about thirteen light-years (so the Sun's neighbourhood is
 * the real one, not a made-up one), the bright stars everyone knows, the ones
 * famous for their planets or their size, and the clusters, nebulae and
 * remnants that make the landmarks of the local arm.
 *
 * Positions are J2000 right ascension and declination (degrees) with a
 * distance in light-years; luminosities (in Suns) are given where the
 * spectral type alone would put a giant too dim. Values are the commonly
 * published ones (RECONS for the nearest systems, Hipparcos/Gaia-era
 * distances for the rest), rounded — facts, not a catalogue's copyrighted
 * compilation. Distances for the most distant supergiants are uncertain by a
 * good fraction, as they are in the literature.
