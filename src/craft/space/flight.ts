/**
 * Flying the ship, the way EVE Online flies ships: you do not steer, you give
 * orders — approach that, orbit this at 20 km, align to that planet, warp to
 * it — and the ship carries them out with its own inertia.
 *
 * - Below warp, velocity closes on the velocity the order wants exponentially:
 *   v += (want − v)(1 − e^(−dt/τ)). τ is the ship's agility; its "align time",
 *   the time to reach three quarters of top speed in a new direction, is τ ln 4.
 * - Warp needs the ship aligned: pointed at the destination and moving at
 *   three quarters of its top speed. Then the speed grows exponentially with
 *   the distance covered, cruises at the ship's warp speed (in AU a second),
 *   and falls exponentially with the distance left, dropping the ship out of
 *   warp at the range asked for, on the side it came from.
 * - Positions are kept relative to the body whose neighbourhood the ship is in
 *   (its sphere of influence, or a small body's own patch of space), so that
 *   "stopped" means stopped beside the planet, not left behind while the planet
 *   sails on round the Sun at 30 km/s. Crossing into another's neighbourhood,
 *   the ship keeps its speed relative to the new body: space is a set of places,
 *   as EVE's grids are, rather than one big inertial frame.
 *
 * That is the arcade model, kept for anyone who wants EVE's grids. The real
 * one — gravity, a thrust-limited engine, orbits that are orbits — is in
 * newton.ts, and uses this file's orders, warp and frames.
 *
 * Pure state and a step function, so the rules are tested without a screen.
