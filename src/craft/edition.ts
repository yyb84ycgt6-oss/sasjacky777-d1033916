/**
 * Which copy of CollinSurvivalCraft this is, and what it can reach.
 *
 * One source runs in two places: inside SAS-JACKY at /craft, signed in with
 * the app's Supabase project behind it, and as the solo download (csc/) with
 * no account and no server. Everything that needs a backend asks here first,
 * so the solo copy hides what it cannot do rather than offering a button that
 * fails the moment it is pressed.
 *
 * Internal names stay "blockcraft" (the IndexedDB database, localStorage keys,
 * the export format, channel names): renaming them would strand every world
 * already saved, and keeping them means a world exported from one edition
 * imports into the other.
