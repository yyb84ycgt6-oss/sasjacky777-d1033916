/**
 * The constellation contract.
 *
 * Jackie is not one app — it is a set of repos that each own one job: a Python
 * engine that decides where work runs, a desktop shell that hosts tools, a
 * vault that holds what must not be lost, model runtimes that do inference on
 * hardware the browser cannot see. Each of those was reachable only by knowing
 * it existed. Nothing named them as one system, so nothing could tell you what
 * was actually running.
 *
 * A `Station` is one such job, declared once. A `StationProbe` answers the only
 * question a caller ever asks about it: is it there right now. Callers depend
 * on `StationProbe` and read `StationStatus` — they never learn whether a
 * station is an in-app route, a build shipped under /public, an HTTP engine, or
 * source that has to be run on a machine. That difference is a property of the
 * probe, normalised here, so adding a new kind of station adds a probe and
 * changes no caller.
