/**
 * An agent inside the app that can act on it, not only talk.
 *
 * The Agent Lab's agents could answer; they could not do anything. This gives
 * any of them — DeepSeek, Hermes, or whatever else is loaded — the same actions
 * an external harness gets through the MCP server (`appActions.ts`), in a loop:
 * the model names one action, the app runs it as the signed-in user, the result
 * goes back to the model, and so on until it answers.
 *
 * The action format is plain text rather than a provider's native tool-calling,
 * because the same agent has to work on DeepSeek's API, on OpenRouter, on LM
 * Studio and on Ollama, and those do not agree on a tool-calling wire format —
 * several local servers do not support one at all. Two shapes are understood:
 *
 *   ```action
 *   {"tool": "create_task", "args": {"title": "…"}}
 *   ```
 *
 * and Hermes's own trained format,
 *
 *   <tool_call>{"name": "create_task", "arguments": {"title": "…"}}</tool_call>
 *
 * so a Hermes model can act in the format it was tuned on. Reasoning models
 * (DeepSeek R1) wrap their thinking in <think>…</think>; that is stripped before
 * parsing and from the final answer.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network or the database directly: the model call
 * and the action executor are injected, which is what lets the loop be tested
 * exactly as it runs.
