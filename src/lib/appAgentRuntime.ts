 * The browser's wiring for `runAppAgent`: which model answers, and who acts.

 * Kept apart from the loop so the loop stays pure and testable. The model is
 * either a provider behind the edge functions (DeepSeek's API, OpenRouter,
 * Ollama or LM Studio through Bionic, …) or a server on this very computer,
 * reached directly. Actions run through `appActions.ts` with the signed-in
 * user's own Supabase session — the same functions and rules the MCP server
 * uses for Hermes Agent and DeepSeek Harness.
