/**
 * Specialised context routers.
 *
 * A micro model is small enough to run on the device and too small to know
 * everything, so the useful unit is not "a model" but "a model plus the slice
 * of local storage it is expert in". Each router below owns one such pairing:
 * a specialisation, the partitions it draws context from, and an ordered ladder
 * of engines to answer with.
 *
 * The ladder is ordered offline-first on purpose. On-device comes before the
 * machine on the LAN, which comes before anything across a network, and the
 * selector will return nothing at all rather than reach for a cloud engine
 * while offline. That is the whole inversion the system is built on: the
 * network is where updates come from, never where answers come from.
