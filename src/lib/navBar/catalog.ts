/**
 * Everything the nav bar can hold — every page and every app this system has.
 *
 * Three sections, because the app is three things sharing one shell: Jackie's
 * own pages, the Eru pages (starting with the forty-two Cybernetic's bar
 * offers, at the paths Eru is mounted under here), and the ninety-odd apps
 * inside the PC.
 *
 * Future-proof by construction: a hand-picked list gives the common pages
 * their icons and order, and everything else is *discovered* — every route the
 * manifest declares and every app the PC roster lists turns up in the editor on
 * its own. A page added to the app tomorrow can be pinned tomorrow, without
 * anyone remembering to add it here.
 *
 * Every `to` is checked against the route manifest by `src/test/nav-bar.test.ts`,
 * so a pinned button can never point at a route the router does not serve: a
 * nav entry that goes nowhere is the one control on screen a person can least
 * afford to have lie to them.
