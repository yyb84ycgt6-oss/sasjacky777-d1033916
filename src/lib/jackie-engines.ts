/**
 * The engines the main chat can answer from, and the order it tries them in.
 *
 * The chat used to have exactly one brain: the Lovable AI gateway, behind the
 * `jackie-chat` function. That made every outage total. If the gateway was
 * rate-limited, out of credit, or simply unreachable, Jackie had nothing to say
 * — even on a rig that was sitting there with its own engine running and a
 * local model loaded.
 *
 * So the chat now has a chain rather than a brain:
 *
 *   1. **Jacky** — the owner's own Flask engine, through the `jacky-proxy`
 *      function. Native, private, and the one that knows the rig. It answers in
 *      one piece rather than streaming, so the router paces it out itself.
 *   2. **Bionic** — a BionicGPT (or any OpenAI-compatible) server on the
 *      operator's own hardware. Streams.
 *   3. **Ollama** — the local runner, through `jackie-ollama`. Streams.
 *   4. **DeepSeek** — DeepSeek's own API, through `jackie-deepseek`. Cheap,
 *      strong, and only there when DEEPSEEK_API_KEY is set. Streams.
 *   5. **Cloud** — the Lovable gateway, last. It costs money and leaves the
 *      building, so it is the safety net, not the default.
 *
 * Order is priority. The router walks it from the chosen engine downward, so a
 * failure anywhere above still ends in an answer as long as one link works.
 *
 * Each engine names the secret that turns it on. An engine whose secret is
 * missing answers with `needs_secret`, which the router treats as "not
 * configured, move on" rather than an error worth stopping for.
