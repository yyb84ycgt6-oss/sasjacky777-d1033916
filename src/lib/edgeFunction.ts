/**
 * Calling this project's edge functions.
 *
 * There is one way to get these headers wrong and it is the way everyone got
 * them wrong: sending the publishable key as a bearer token.
 *
 * This project's key is the new opaque kind (`sb_publishable_…`), not a JWT.
 * The generated Supabase client already knows that — `createSupabaseFetch` in
 * `integrations/supabase/client.ts` deliberately *deletes* an Authorization
 * header holding that key and sends it as `apikey` instead. But every
 * hand-written `fetch` to a function bypassed the client and did the forbidden
 * thing, with no `apikey` at all. The gateway rejects that before the function
 * runs, and the browser reports the rejection as `TypeError: Failed to fetch` —
 * a message that names neither the cause nor the fix, which is how the chat sat
 * broken behind an error nobody could act on.
 *
 * So the rules, in one place:
 *
 * - `apikey` always carries the publishable key. That is what it is for.
 * - `Authorization` carries the signed-in user's access token, because the
 *   functions read it: `jackie-chat` calls `supabase.auth.getClaims(token)` and
 *   answers 401 to anything that is not a real user JWT.
 * - No session means no Authorization header, and a caller that needs one is
 *   told it is not signed in rather than being sent to fail at the gateway.
