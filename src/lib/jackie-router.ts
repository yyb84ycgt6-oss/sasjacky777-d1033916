/**
 * Which engine answers, and what happens when it cannot.
 *
 * The chat had one route and no recovery. `streamChat` went to the cloud
 * gateway, and when the gateway said no — no key, no credit, rate limited,
 * unreachable — the send ended in a toast and an empty bubble. Nothing tried
 * anything else, so a rig with its own engine running and a model loaded still
 * had a dead chat.
 *
 * This walks `jackie-engines`' chain instead. It starts at whichever engine is
 * chosen, and on any failure that another engine could plausibly answer it
 * moves down: Jacky → Bionic → Ollama → Cloud. Only two things stop the walk:
 *
 *   - the user aborted, which is not a failure and must not be retried
 *     somewhere else, and
 *   - there is no signed-in session, which every engine would refuse
 *     identically, so trying four of them is four identical errors.
 *
 * A failover is reported through `onRoute` rather than swallowed. An answer
 * that quietly came from somewhere other than the engine named on screen is
 * how a chat ends up lying about what it is.
 *
 * Partial output is the one case that needs care. If an engine streamed some
 * tokens and then broke, the next engine starts a *fresh* answer — it never
 * saw the half one — so appending its text to what is on screen produced
 * "The capital of France is Paris is the capital of France." and saved that,
 * as one reply, to the database, the history and the memory extractor. So
 * before a failover that follows output, the router calls `onReset` and the
 * caller clears the half answer. A caller that cannot reset gets the break
 * reported as an error instead, with nothing spliced.
