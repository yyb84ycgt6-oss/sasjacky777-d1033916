/**
 * The catalogs, the fallback chain, and the QA that stops a bad translation
 * reaching a person.
 *
 * The premise: nobody on the team reads all six languages, so correctness in
 * five of them cannot come from review. It has to come from checks that a
 * machine can run — which is what this file is. Three defects are caught here,
 * and each one is invisible to an English-speaking reviewer:
 *
 *  1. A plural message missing a category the language requires. Russian needs
 *     four; a translator handing back two produces "5 станция" forever.
 *  2. A placeholder renamed in English and not in the translation. The
 *     translated string then renders a literal `{count}` to the user.
 *  3. A string left in English. Not an error — some are correct untranslated —
 *     but it must be counted and visible, not silently shipped as "done".
